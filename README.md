I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur), pursuing a BTech + MTech (Dual Degree) in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering.

My research interest lies primarily in the field of Deep Learning and the algorithms in the domain. Other times, I enjoy doing competitive programming and learning new algorithms and data structures.

Shoot me an email if you got any cool idea and wish to collaborate!
