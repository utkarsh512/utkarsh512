I am currently a pre-final year student at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur), pursuing a BTech + MTech (Dual Degree) in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering.

My research interest lies primarily in the field of Natural Language Processing. Other times, I enjoy doing competitive programming and learning new algorithms and data structures.
